    <h2>Soft due date: 2/9/2021</h2>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <h3>The purpose of this project is to demonstrate understanding of the following course outcomes:
        <ol>
            <li>Gather and analyze requirements to design and plan a website.</li>
            <li>Produce professional websites that adhere to appropriate/established standards, including usability, accessibility, and validation.</li>
            <li>Select and apply the necessary tools, protocols, and resources to support web technologies.</li>
            <li>Select comply with legal precedent and ethical standards when constructing websites.</li>
        </ol>
    </h3>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Create a proposal for the Final Website Project that explains the topic, purpose, goals, target audience(s), description of the site and business, organization, testing, security and search engine optimization/marketing.</h3>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <h3>The goal of the website project for this course is to demonstrate an ability to apply the skills learned during the term by creating a real-world website project. The main purpose of the project is to learn to conduct good project planning, including development of website marketing strategies (e.g., search-engine optimization) and identifying performance and security risks. As part of proper project planning, best practices dictate the use of a proposal for establishing the requirements of a websiteâ€™s design. Therefore, students will submit a proposal/plan for website creation. Project 2 topics must be approved by the instructor and then the student will create a full-functioning website in Project 4.</h3>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>For this project, the student will create a proposal/plan in Project 2 and then in Project 4, build out the website proposed. It is important to think about what will comprise the 10 pages - colors, fonts, images, target audience, content for pages, etc. Each criterion in the grading rubric should be carefully considered when creating this proposal in order to achieve the highest grade. The website must contain a minimum of 10 newly created HTML5 web pages (not including files, such as .txt, .js, or .css). The website must be original work created during this term and cannot have been previously created for any other purpose, including pages created in previous projects for this course. Your Project 4 can be a website designed for your workplace, nonprofit/volunteer work, or another business/organization, real or fictitious. Hopefully, the project will be something of benefit that the student can take away from this course.</h3>
