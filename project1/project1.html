    <h1>Project 1: SEO Best Practices, Accessibility, User Engagement</h1>
    <h2>How search engines work.</h2>
    <h3>Crawler-based engines use automation to crawl and catalog the internet. Human-based engines manually catalog using human beings. Hybrid engines use crawlers to compile data and a human to assign rankings. Search engines determine rankings by using closely guarded algorithms or a variation of a base search engine to compile ranks.</h3>
    <h2>The importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags.</h2>
    <h3>The description meta tag give search engines a summary of what the page is about. Unlike the page title, the description can be multiple sentences long. This description can be important as Google might use it as a snippet for the page. The keyword meta tags also describe the content of the website but are short and concise. While keywords are no longer valuable to SEO, descriptions that are well-crafted can help improve your websiteâ€™s traffic.</h3>
    <h2>Four elements that comprise writing relevant content links.</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The link text should be descriptive, concise, and easy to spot.</li>
            <li>Be careful who you link to as you may become guilty by association if the linked website is spammy.</li>
            <li>Anchor text should be succinct, relevant, have low keyword density and be non-generic.</li>
            <li>Create a crawlable link structure with standard HTML links, so that crawlers can find all the pages on a website.</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>What constitutes good heading hierarchy?</h2>
    <h3>Headings should be used as if you are writing an outline for a paper. They should be used sparingly and only when appropriate as the topic is important. This hierarchical structure guides readers as they navigate through the document. H1 tags also have relevance to search engines as it interprets larger words as more important. Hence, the CSS sheet should style H1 as larger text than others.</h3>
